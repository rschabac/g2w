small example of rewriting: replace 'auto' type with actual type, if actual type is succinct
AST-based macros: #expand tells the compiler to change the source file
	maybe also add #expand_recursively to expand all nested macros
	will need to keep all info about source file through lexing and parsing
polymorphism can be done with type erasure OR separately optimized
	template expansion (separately optimized) generates additional file with instantiations
	type erasure will need to prevent doing type-specific things with values
		can only be used like a void*
	hybrid mode: type-erased for pointer types, specialized for non-pointer types

maybe:
	Sum types
	unity builds are default, whole directory compilation

write interpreter first to test
